    <h2><em>This school is one of the most amazing schools in New York in my opinion. this school gives you the opportunity to get hands on experience with being a teacher's Assistant. In 12th grade you can leave the school and work with younger students in another school. This school is surrounded  by food shops and carts as well as shopping centers close by.You can inetrn in 9th or 10/11th grade classes as well.</em></h2>

    <h3>My friends and I like to go to battery park to play volleyball. We stay until four or later. sometimes we like to go to the apple store to exchange our headphones and price the things that we want or plan on getting. My friends and I like to walk to wendys and buy food and chill while we talk. Lastly my friends and I like to go on the staten Island ferry when it is nice outside. </h3>
